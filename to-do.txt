SQLiteModel
[ ] Scrub "id" in sql_for_find_by_id() (security: tainted-data)
[ ] []=() verify that "attribute" is in the schema for the table.
[ ] Clarify the use of strings and symbols when referring to attributes: raw values (e.g. used to create an instance of a model) can be either, for convenience's sake; but the keys of the hash backing a model instance (persisted or not) will ALWAYS be symbols.
[ ] Add check to make sure we're connected before doing anything. (and raise an exception if not)
[ ] In all generated SQL, capitalize SQL keywords
[x] Add logic to connect to a given database.
